### Please note before start reading
Those code examples about design pattern have the purpose of personal use, to easily remember the patters; it's like a notepad. I took the following examples from Youtube and some web articles.

The major source of the examples is a Youtube channel of [DoableDanny](https://www.youtube.com/@doabledanny/videos), he's a very good developer. I suggest to all to buy ðŸ“’his book about design pattern ðŸ“’ , it's very clear.

# Builder pattern

 The Builder pattern provide a method to create step by step an object providing flexibility and clarity about the building process. \
 For every function of builder class you can return itself for create a fluent builder, you can concatenate a method one after one when you construct it. \
 In the first example you can see a guided builder (example M8), or the use of delegate (M6) for passing parameters data. (For use of Delegate you can see another repository about it).
